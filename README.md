# Arduino-Project
Here I have shared one of my hardware project -"**Air quality checking with Android Application**" which I have done using **Arduino**. 
I have done this project in the 2nd Year of my College as a BCT project.
I have used **NODEMCU ESP8266(ESP-12E),** **MQ-135 AIR QUALITY SENSOR** & **Blynk Iot App** to Perform this Project
